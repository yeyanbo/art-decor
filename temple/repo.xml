    <description>DECOR Temple Editor is the advanced version of the default version contained in ART. It allows direct manipulation of the underlying definition in XML. It supports content completion, and validation of the definition before saving. While Temple is in its alpha stage, the button to call Temple from the template form is only available when the user has debug rights.</description>
